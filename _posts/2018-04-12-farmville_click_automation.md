A tool to automate the overhead of farm maintenance. Nobody plays Farmville now, but when it was all the rage, this utility would harvest all my farmville crop in one click!

This will work with other games that use a similar mechanic.

When you middle click on a crop tile, this utility will capture an image of it and click on it and all similar-looking tiles until none are left to harvest.
